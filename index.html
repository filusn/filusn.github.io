        <p>
            I am a data analyst and Python developer who loves data science.
            I have a wide range of interests, especially in the field of 
            artificial intelligence. I want to design systems that help
            people by improving their lifes.

            I completed my B.S. at AGH University of Science and Technology.
            My thesis was <span class='title'>Tumour cell detection on 
            confocal microscopy images</span>. It was my first research
            exploring use of data science and image processing on the health field.

            <!-- Meanwhile I started internship at IBM Poland and later work at
            Aptiv (former Delphi) as data analyst. Now I work at FEV Poland
            and in my free time I am learning and developing my interests.<br> -->
