        <p>
            I am a Python developer who loves data science. I have a wide 
            range of interests, especially in the field of artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            My target is to be able to build marvelous tools, systems and
            applications that could help a lot of people. But that is the future.
            Right now I am just at the start of my data science path, so I am
            trying to gain more and more of related knowledge to became
            expert data scientist.

            On my way to being pro, I am learning by having fun with data and 
            creating stuff related to my interests. You can find my research 
            exploring use of data science on various fields (health, art, sport 
            and others) in the
